### Overview
A "JOB-BOARD"
My Plan is to have an all in one board where,
I can see posting from all the sites and its really 
easy to add custom sites someone wanted to track.

 ### Ingredients
 Everything 'should' work in docker
 - Server
    - Typescript 
    - Typeorm
    - Type-GraphQL
    - Postgres (For storage)
    - Redis (For caching)
    - Express
    - Apollo GraphQL
    - Argon2 (for password hashing)
- Web
    - Next.js 
- Mobile
    - React Native
- Desktop
    - Electron

#### Note Haven't decide Web, Mobile and Desktop yet
